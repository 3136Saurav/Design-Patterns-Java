/*
The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.

Principle of Least Knowledge: talk only to your immediate friends
