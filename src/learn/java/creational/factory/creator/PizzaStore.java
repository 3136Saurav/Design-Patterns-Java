/*
Factory Design Pattern - Creational Design Pattern
- defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Java Classes - JDBC, Logging Frameworks (Log4j, Logback), Swing, JavaFX

Use the Factory Method when you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.

Pros -
You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.
Single Responsibility Principle - You can move the product creation code into one place in the program, making the code easier to support.
Open/Closed Principle - You can introduce new types of products
into the program without breaking existing client code
