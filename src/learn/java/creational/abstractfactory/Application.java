/*
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
An Abstract Factory gives us an interface for creating a family of products. By writing code that uses this interface, we decouple our code
from the actual factory that creates the products. That allows us to implement a variety of factories that produce products meant for different
contextsâ€”such as different regions, different operating systems, or different look and feels.
